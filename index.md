## **About Me**

I'm learning coding at home whilst still locked away whilst the world goes a little bit crazy outside.
I've been in education for far too long, and I need a break... for now!


### Things I like _more_ than computers!
- Microbes!
- Medical History!
- Crochet!
- Knitting!
- Cake!
- Crafts!
- Glitter!
